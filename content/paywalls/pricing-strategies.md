How to price your GPTs for maximum revenue and user adoption.

Pricing your GPT correctly is crucial for success. Price too high and you'll lose potential customers; too low and you'll leave money on the table. This guide helps you find the sweet spot.

## Factors to Consider

Before setting your price, consider:

### 1. Value Delivered
- What problem does your GPT solve?
- How much time/money does it save users?
- What's the alternative cost? (hiring a consultant, using multiple tools, etc.)

### 2. Target Audience
- Who are your ideal customers?
- What's their budget capacity?
- Are they individuals or businesses?

### 3. Competition
- What do similar GPTs charge?
- What features do you offer that others don't?
- Can you differentiate on quality or specialization?

### 4. Your Costs
- Consider Authflow fees (10% per transaction)
- Consider Stripe fees (~2.9% + $0.30)
- Factor in your time investment

## Common Pricing Tiers

- Professional productivity tools
- Content creation assistants

**Pros:**
- Balance of accessibility and value
- Sustainable revenue per user
- Most common and accepted range

**Cons:**

### Premium ($20-100/month)

**Best for:**
- Specialized professional tools
- Business-focused GPTs
- High-value niches (legal, medical, finance)

**Pros:**

- Better revenue per customer

**Cons:**

### Enterprise ($100+/month)

**Pros:**

**Cons:**

## Pricing Psychology Tips

### Use Charm Pricing
- $9.99 feels significantly less than $10.00
- $19/month feels more accessible than $20/month

### Anchor with Annual Pricing
- Show annual price as the "best value"
- Offer 15-20% discount for annual
- Monthly becomes the "convenient" option

### Highlight Value, Not Features
- "Save 10 hours per week" beats "10 features included"
- Focus on outcomes, not inputs

### Offer Multiple Tiers (if applicable)
- Make the middle tier the most attractive
- Use the high tier to make the middle look reasonable

## Testing and Iteration

### Start Conservative
- It's easier to lower prices than raise them
- You can always add promotional discounts

### Use Analytics
- Track conversion rates at different price points
- Monitor churn rates
- A/B test pricing when possible

### Listen to Feedback
- If many users say it's too expensive, consider adjusting
- If no one complains, you might be underpriced

## Example Pricing Calculation
