# Free Trials & Discounts

Free trials and discounts are powerful tools for attracting customers and increasing conversions. When used strategically, they can significantly boost your subscriber count.

## Why Offer Free Trials?

Free trials remove the risk barrier for potential customers:

- **Reduce friction**: Users can try before they buy
- **Demonstrate value**: Let your GPT prove its worth
- **Build trust**: Show confidence in your product
- **Increase conversions**: Users who try often convert

> **Stat:** GPTs with 7-day free trials see up to 3x higher conversion rates compared to those without.

## Setting Up Free Trials

When creating a paywall with subscription pricing:

1. Check the **"Offer Free Trial"** option
2. Select the **Trial Duration** (1-14 days available)
3. Users will get full access during the trial period
4. After the trial, their payment method is automatically charged

### Recommended Trial Lengths

| Duration | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **3 days** | Simple tools, quick value demonstration |
| **7 days** | Most GPTs (recommended default) |
| **14 days** | Complex tools, business users |

## How Free Trials Work

### User Experience

1. User clicks your paywall link
2. Enters payment information (required to start trial)
3. Gets immediate full access to your GPT
4. Receives reminder emails before trial ends
5. Automatically converts to paid subscription
6. Can cancel anytime during trial with no charge

### Your Dashboard

You can track:
- Active trial users
- Trial-to-paid conversion rate
- Upcoming trial expirations
- Cancelled trials

## Free Trial Best Practices

### 1. Require Payment Info Upfront

This ensures:
- Higher quality trial users (serious intent)
- Seamless conversion to paid
- Fewer abandoned trials

### 2. Choose the Right Duration

- Too short: Users don't experience full value
- Too long: Users delay engagement, forget about it
- Sweet spot: 7 days for most GPTs

### 3. Onboard Trial Users Well

- Send a welcome email with getting-started tips
- Highlight key features they should try
- Send a reminder email before trial ends

### 4. Deliver Value Quickly

- Make sure users experience a "wow moment" in the first session
- Design for quick wins
- Remove friction from first-time use

## Discounts and Promotions

### Coupon Codes

Create discount codes for:
- Launch promotions
- Seasonal offers
- Partner promotions
- Influencer collaborations

### Limited-Time Offers

Create urgency with:
- "Launch price: $9/month (regular $19)"
- "50% off for the first 100 subscribers"
- Holiday or seasonal discounts

### Annual Subscription Discounts

Encourage annual commitments:
- Typical discount: 15-30% off monthly rate
- Frame as "2 months free" or "Save $X"
- Reduces churn, improves cash flow

## Measuring Trial Success

| Metric | What to Track |
|--------|---------------|
| **Trial starts** | How many people begin trials |
| **Trial-to-paid rate** | % of trials that convert |
| **Time to convert** | How long until users become paid |
| **Trial cancellations** | % who cancel during trial |

### Healthy Benchmarks

- Trial-to-paid rate: 20-40% is good, 40%+ is excellent
- Most conversions happen in days 5-7 of a 7-day trial
- Early cancellations may indicate onboarding issues

## Example Trial Setup

**GPT:** Research Assistant Pro

**Configuration:**
- Price: $19/month
- Free trial: 7 days
- Annual option: $159/year (save $69)

**Onboarding sequence:**
- Day 1: Welcome email with quick start guide
- Day 3: "Did you try X feature?" email
- Day 5: Success story + reminder trial ending soon
- Day 7: Trial ends, automatic conversion

**Results to expect:**
- 30-40% of trial users convert to paid
- Most engaged users upgrade to annual for savings
