# 🧾 Stripe Onboarding Guide for New Users

Welcome aboard! Now that you've connected your Stripe account, you're ready to accept payments and receive payouts. This guide walks you through what to expect, how to manage your account, and how to make the most out of Stripe.

## 🎉 Step 1: Confirm Your Account Is Active

After connecting your Stripe account:

* ✅ **Payouts Enabled**: Stripe can now transfer money to your bank.
* ✅ **Charges Enabled**: You're authorized to collect payments from customers.

> 🔍 To check your status, visit your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings) → *Settings* → *Account details*. Look for "Charges enabled" and "Payouts enabled".

## 💸 Step 2: Understand Your Payout Schedule

Stripe sends funds to your bank on a rolling basis:

- **Default**: 2 business days (U.S.)
- **First payout**: Might take up to 7 days
- **Subsequent payouts**: Depend on your country and risk level

> 📆 View and manage this under **Dashboard** → *Balance* → *Payouts*.

## 📊 Step 3: Monitor Your Transactions

You can view all incoming payments:

- Navigate to **Payments** in your dashboard
- Filter by date, payment method, customer, etc.
- Click any row to see full payment details

> 💬 Tip: Failed or disputed payments will show up here too, so check this tab regularly.

## 🏦 Step 4: Track Payouts to Your Bank

In the **Payouts** section:

- See when funds are sent
- Review amounts, fees, and balance history
- Click on any payout to see the list of included payments

> 💡 Tip: If a payout fails, Stripe will notify you and retry.

Go to **Dashboard** → *Settings* → *Branding* and *Public Details*.
