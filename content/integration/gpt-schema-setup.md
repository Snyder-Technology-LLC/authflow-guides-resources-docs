How to copy and paste the Authflow schema into your GPT action.

---

The schema is an OpenAPI specification that tells your GPT how to communicate with the Authflow API. This guide shows you how to copy and paste it correctly.

## What is the Schema?

The GPT Schema is:
- An OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Defines the Authflow API endpoints
- Tells your GPT what actions are available
- Includes the "check active paywall" endpoint

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Copy the Schema from Authflow

1. Go to your paywall details page in Authflow
2. Find the section labeled **"GPT Schema"**
3. Click the **"Copy"** button next to it

> **Note:** You don't need to format this - just copy it as-is.

### 2. Paste into Your GPT Action

1. In your GPT's action configuration, find the schema/OpenAPI field
2. It's a large text box for entering the specification
3. **Paste** the schema (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)
4. You don't need to format it - just paste directly

### 3. Verify the Schema

After pasting:

- **No errors in red** = You're good! ✅
- **Errors in red** = Something went wrong (see troubleshooting below)
- You should see an available action called **"check active paywall"** appear

### 4. Optional: Format the Schema

You can click the **"Format"** button if you want prettier JSON, but it's not required for functionality.

## What the Schema Contains

The schema includes:

- **API endpoint URL** for Authflow's verification service
- **Request format** for checking subscriptions
- **Response format** for verification results
- **Authentication requirements**

## Troubleshooting Schema Issues

### Errors Showing in Red

If you see red error messages:

1. **Check for partial copy** - Make sure you copied the entire schema
2. **Refresh and retry** - Sometimes refreshing the page helps
3. **Clear and repaste** - Delete everything and paste again
4. **Check for extra characters** - Make sure no stray characters were added

### Schema Doesn't Appear Correctly

- Verify you're pasting into the correct field (the OpenAPI/schema text area)
- Try using a different browser
- Clear your browser cache

### "check active paywall" Action Not Appearing

- Ensure the schema was pasted completely
- Look for red error indicators
- Try formatting the schema with the Format button

## Tips

> **💡 Pro Tip:** The schema is auto-generated by Authflow and includes everything you need. You should never need to manually edit it.
