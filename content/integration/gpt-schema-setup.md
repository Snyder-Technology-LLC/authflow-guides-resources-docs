# Paste the GPT Schema

The schema is an OpenAPI specification that tells your GPT how to communicate with the Authflow API. This guide shows you how to copy and paste it correctly.

## What is the Schema?

The GPT Schema is:
- An OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Defines the Authflow API endpoints
- Tells your GPT what actions are available
- Includes the "check active paywall" endpoint

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Copy the Schema from Authflow

1. Go to your paywall details page in Authflow
2. Find the section labeled **"GPT Schema"**
3. Click the **"Copy"** button next to it

> **Note:** You don't need to format this - just copy it as-is.

### 2. Paste into Your GPT Action

1. In your GPT's action configuration, find the schema/OpenAPI field
2. It's a large text box for entering the specification
3. **Paste** the schema (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)
4. You don't need to format it - just paste directly

### 3. Verify the Schema

After pasting:

- **No errors in red** = You're good! ✅
- **Errors in red** = Something went wrong (see troubleshooting below)
- You should see an available action called **"check active paywall"** appear

### 4. Optional: Format the Schema

You can click the **"Format"** button if you want prettier JSON, but it's not required for functionality.

## What the Schema Contains

The schema includes:

- **API endpoint URL** for Authflow's verification service
- **Request format** for checking subscriptions
- **Response format** for verification results
- **Authentication requirements**

## Troubleshooting Schema Issues

### Errors Showing in Red

If you see red error messages:

1. **Check for partial copy** - Make sure you copied the entire schema
2. **Refresh and retry** - Sometimes refreshing the page helps
3. **Clear and repaste** - Delete everything and paste again
4. **Check for extra characters** - Make sure no stray characters were added

### Schema Doesn't Appear Correctly

- Verify you're pasting into the correct field (the OpenAPI/schema text area)
- Try using a different browser
- Clear your browser cache

### "check active paywall" Action Not Appearing

- Ensure the schema was pasted completely
- Look for red error indicators
- Try formatting the schema with the Format button

## Tips

> **💡 Pro Tip:** The schema is auto-generated by Authflow and includes everything you need. You should never need to manually edit it.

## Next Steps
