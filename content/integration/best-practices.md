These proven strategies will help you optimize your GPT monetization and build a sustainable income stream.

## 1. Optimize Your GPT Description

Your GPT description is your sales pitch. Make it count.

### Do This:
- **Lead with value** - What problem do you solve?
- **Be specific** - "Save 5 hours per week" beats "Save time"
- **Include use cases** - Help users imagine using it
- **Highlight uniqueness** - What makes you different?

### Example:

> ❌ "An AI assistant for writing"

> ✅ "Turn rough ideas into polished blog posts in minutes. Perfect for content marketers who need to publish 3x more without hiring writers. Includes SEO optimization, tone matching, and one-click formatting."

## 2. Set Competitive Pricing

### Research First
- Check what similar GPTs charge
- Consider your target audience's budget
- Use [Authflow's Pricing Optimizer](https://www.authflow.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=github_docs&utm_content=bestpractices_pricingoptimizer_cta#pricing-optimizer) for suggestions

### Test and Iterate
- Start with your best guess
- Monitor conversion rates
- Adjust based on data
- Consider seasonal promotions

### Price Anchoring
- Show annual savings clearly
- Use the "Save X%" messaging
- Make monthly the "convenient" option

## 3. Offer Free Trials

Free trials dramatically increase conversions.

### Why They Work

### Best Practices
- 7 days is the sweet spot for most GPTs
- Require payment info upfront (higher quality leads)
- Send onboarding emails during trial
- Remind users before trial ends

## 4. Create Multiple Tiers

Different users have different needs and budgets.

### Tier Strategy
- **Entry tier** - Affordable, attracts volume
- **Standard tier** - Your main offering, best value
- **Premium tier** - For power users, makes standard look reasonable

### Pricing Psychology
- Make the middle option most attractive
- Use decoy pricing if needed
- Clearly differentiate what each tier includes

## 5. Focus on User Experience

## 6. Market Your GPT

Build an audience beyond the ChatGPT Store.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pricing too low** - Undervalues your work, harder to raise later
2. **No free trial** - Loses potential customers who need to try first
3. **Poor description** - Doesn't communicate value
4. **Ignoring feedback** - Miss improvement opportunities
5. **Set and forget** - Need ongoing improvement and marketing
6. **No support** - Users feel abandoned
7. **Inconsistent quality** - Damages trust and increases churn

## Your Revenue Formula

```
Revenue = (Visitors × Conversion Rate × Price) - Churn Losses
```

Improve each factor:
- **Visitors** → Marketing and distribution
- **Conversion Rate** → Description, pricing, free trials
- **Price** → Value-based pricing, tiers
- **Churn** → User experience, support, ongoing value

Focus on the factor with the most room for improvement.
