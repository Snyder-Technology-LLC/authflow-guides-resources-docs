How to add the privacy policy to your GPT action.

---

Every GPT action requires a privacy policy URL. Authflow provides one for you to use with the paywall integration.

## Why a Privacy Policy?

OpenAI requires a privacy policy for GPT actions because:

- Actions can collect user data (like email addresses)
- Users need to know how their data is handled
- It's required for your action to work properly

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Copy the Privacy Policy URL

1. Go to your paywall details page in Authflow
2. Find the section labeled **"Privacy Policy"**
3. Click the **"Copy"** button

### 2. Paste into Your GPT Action

1. In your GPT action configuration
2. Find the **"Privacy Policy"** field
3. **Paste** the URL you copied

### 3. Save

Click Save to confirm the privacy policy is added.

## What the Privacy Policy Covers

Authflow's privacy policy explains:

- What data is collected (email for verification)
- How data is used (subscription verification)
- How data is protected
- User rights regarding their data

## Important Notes

### For the Authflow Action Only

This privacy policy is specific to the Authflow paywall action. If you have:

- **Other actions** in your GPT → You may want a separate privacy policy for those
- **Just the Authflow action** → The provided privacy policy is all you need

### Don't Skip This Step

Without a privacy policy:
- Your action may not work correctly
- Users may see warnings
- OpenAI may restrict your action

## Verification

After adding the privacy policy:

- ✅ The Privacy Policy field should show the Authflow URL
- ✅ No error messages about missing privacy policy
- ✅ Action should be ready to save
